 Overview:
This project implements steganography to securely hide secret data inside images without altering their appearance. It ensures confidential communication by embedding encrypted messages within image pixels.

Features:
✅ Data hiding inside images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique.
✅ Secure encryption before embedding for extra protection.
✅ Lossless image quality with hidden data.
✅ Data extraction to retrieve hidden messages.
✅ Simple and efficient implementation using Python.

 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
OpenCV – For image processing
string-Text handling and manipulation
Cryptography – For encryption
OS- file handling and directory operations

 How It Works:
1️⃣ Select an image to embed data.
2️⃣ Enter the secret message.
3️⃣ Encode the message into the image.
4️⃣ Send/store the stego-image securely.
5️⃣ Decode the message from the image when needed.

 Future Enhancements:
AES encryption for additional security.
Support for audio and video steganography.
GUI for user-friendly interaction.
